# Learning Programming Languages

This repository is dedicated to learning different programming languages by studying their core concepts.  
Each folder represents a language (e.g., Python, C++), and inside each language folder, topics are grouped by programming concepts such as loops, functions, and algorithms.

## Goals

- Understand how different languages implement fundamental programming concepts.
- Practice solving small problems to reinforce syntax and logic.
- Build a personal reference for future coding.

## Languages

- üêç Python  
- üíª C++  
*(More may be added later)*

## Topics Covered

- Basic syntax  
- Control structures (if, for, while)  
- Functions (regular, recursive)  
- Common algorithms (sorting, searching)  
- Data structures (optional/future)
